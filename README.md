## Introduction
This project utilizes historical insurance data to predict the amount of insurance required for new clients. The model considers various factors like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region to make accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creates new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes various regression algorithms to predict insurance amounts.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Installation
To run the Insurance Amount Prediction project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance_amount_prediction.git
    cd insurance_amount_prediction
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare your dataset**:
    Ensure you have your dataset in the correct format (e.g., CSV) and place it in the project directory.

2. **Run the training script**:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```

3. **Make predictions**:
    Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
    ```sh
    python predict.py --input your_input_data.csv --output predictions.csv
    ```

## Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
